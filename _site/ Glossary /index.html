<p>Described in this glossary are some terms used in the context of
policies and the implementation of open data.</p>

<h2 id="terms">Terms</h2>

<h3 id="a">A</h3>

<h4 id="api">API</h4>

<p>[APIs] (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api) of <em>Application Programming Interface</em>
(In Portuguese: Application Programming Interface) is a set of routines
and standards set by software for the use of its features
for applications that do not wish to engage in implementation details
software, but only use their services.</p>

<p>In the context of web development, an API, also of chamda
[Web API] (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api#API_Web) is a defined set of messages
HTTP request and response, usually expressed in XML or JSON formats. Yet
that term is a synonym for web service, the so-called Web 2.0 is slowly
depreciating the model for technical services SOAP REST.</p>

<h4 id="machine-readable-files">Machine Readable Files</h4>

<p>[Machine Readable File] (https://www.niem.gov/glossary/Pages/Glossary.aspx?alpha=M)
refers to information or data into a format that can be
easily processed by a computer without human intervention,
ensuring no semantic meaning is lost</p>

<h3 id="c">C</h3>

<h4 id="csv">CSV</h4>

<p>Can mean
[<em>Comma-Separated Values</em>] (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)
(Comma separated values) or, <em>Character-Separated Values</em>
(Separated by character values). It is a format for storing data
tabular text. The coding is very simple: each line of the file
represents a row in the table, and the columns are separated by commas.
Fields that can contain commas must be delimited
by quotation marks. CSV is recommended for representing data structure more
simple tabular in nature, where there are subproperties or lists,
resulting in a smaller and lighter file for processing. CSV files are
directly processable by editors spreadsheets like OpenOffice and MS
Excel.</p>

<h3 id="e">E</h3>

<p>And ####-MAG</p>

<p>The [Accessibility Model in Electronic Government] (http://www.governoeletronico.gov.br/acoes-and-projetos/e-MAG)

is reassure people, researching information on the Web Brazilian government,
fast and efficient access to descriptions of resources. The PMG-elements and have
purpose of facilitating the location of the resources that people need
even if they do not have detailed knowledge of the location or the entity responsible for the information.</p>

<h4 id="e-pwg">E-PWG</h4>

<p>The [Web Standards in Electronic Government (ePWG)] (http://www.governoeletronico.gov.br/acoes-and-projetos/padroes-Brazil-e-gov)
are recommendations for best practices in grouped format booklets aimed
enhance communication and providing information and services provided by
electronic organs by means of the Federal Government.</p>

<h4 id="and-sic-">And SIC-</h4>

<p>The [System Electronic Information Service Citizen] (http://www.acessoainformacao.gov.br/sistema/site/index.html?ReturnUrl=%2fsistema%2f)
(E-SIC) is the [Citizens Information Service] (# service-to-information-to-citizen) of the Federal Executive
provided on the web. It allows any person or entity, forward requests for access
information, follow the deadline and receive a response to the request made organs
and entities of the Federal Executive. Citizens can still enter with resources and present
complaints without bureaucracy.</p>

<p>ETL ####</p>

<p>ETL, English [Extract Transform Load] (http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)
(Extract Transform Load) tools are software whose function is the extraction
data from various systems, transformation of these data as business rules
and finally the load of data usually in a Data Mart and Data Warehouse but nothing
prevents is also to send data to a particular system organization.
The extraction and load are required for the process, and the transformation / optional cleaning
but are good practice, given that the data have already been sent to the
the target system. It is considered one of the most critical phases of Data Warehouse and / or Data Mart.</p>

<h3 id="g">G</h3>

<h4 id="geojson">GeoJSON</h4>

<p>It is an open format based on [JSON] (# json) to represent information
geographical. Enables representing forms such as points, lines and polygons
with geographic coordinates, along with their non-spatial attributes.
The GeoJSON is not maintained by a formal standardization body, as some
other formats for geographic information. Instead, it is
[Specified] (http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html)
by a working group of developers.</p>

<h3 id="h">H</h3>

<h4 id="hackathon">Hackathon</h4>

<p>A [hackathon] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon)
(Also known as a Hack Day, Hackfest or codefest) is a
event where programmers and others involved in development
software, including graphic designers, interface designers and managers
project, collaborate intensively on software projects in a period
short time which can last from 24 hours to 1 week.</p>

It is an open standard data structuring text-based and readable
human. The specification is the [RFC 7159] (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159).
JSON gained increased use with the use of dynamic load Content
web pages with Javascript (technique called “Ajax”). The serialization
JSON is very simple and results in a
little verbose structure which shows a great alternative to XML.
JSON serialization allows the structure of complex objects, such as lists and
subproperties. JSON is becoming the most widely used standard for integration
data between repositories and frameworks, is also becoming the standard
native storage in some modern databases.</p>

<h5 id="json-ld">JSON-LD</h5>

<p>It is a format based on
[JSON for Linked Data] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD), also
[Standardized] (http://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/) in 2014.
Brings all the advantages of JSON format. A mapping framework for IRIs
can optionally be separated into a JSON document context, which leaves
the main JSON, where the data are essentially the same structure that
JSON a common document.</p>

<h3 id="k">K</h3>

<h4 id="kml">KML</h4>

<p>Acronym for
[Keyhole Markup Language] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) _. _
It is an XML-based format, originally developed by Google and later
[Standardized] (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml) by Open Geospatial
Consortium. May represent geographical information, such as
placemarks, images, polygons, three dimensional models, or descriptions
textual, using latitude, longitude and elevation coordinates as
[WGS84] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System). system</p>

<p>In some cases the KML files are distributed compressed in zip format

under standard
[ISO / IEC 26300: 2006] (http://www.abntcatalogo.com.br/norma.aspx?ID=1549).
It is commonly called a spreadsheet, similar
XLS to MS Office Excel, but open, so it should be used in
replacing the XLS. Spreadsheets are widely used, are easily
used and manipulated by different applications. Although a format
structured, is very flexible, enabling manipulation and mixing
various types of data such as images and formatted text. For publication
open tabular data, it is recommended to use CSV, for its
simplicity and standardization.</abbr></p>

<h4 id="ogp">OGP</h4>

<p>OGP is the acronym for Open Government Partnership in translating to Portuguese

guides the actions of implementation and promotion of open data, including spatial distribution,
of an organization. The document is part of the open data policy, and its goal is
organize and standardize the processes of publishing open data state, resulting
improving the quality of services provided to citizens and the public administration itself.</p>

<h4 id="open-government-partnership">Open Government Partnership</h4>

launched in 2011, is an international initiative that aims to disseminate and encourage
globally governmental practices related to government transparency,
access to public information and social participation.</p>

<h3 id="r">R</h3>

<p>RDF ####</p>

<p>The family of formats
[RDF] (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework)
is based on a metamodel graph to indicate the relationships between
nodes, where each node can be anything about which wants to assert
something. This metamodel allows to establish semantic relations between the
data, to describe them as a model (vocabulary or ontology)
preset information for that domain.</p>

<p>This meta-data as graphs can be stored in databases
specialized data, called stores_ _triple or triple banks, a
reference to how to describe the graph listing each triple node-edge-node,
representing subject, predicate and object.</p>

<p>When recording RDF data in a file, however, you must choose one of
multiple syntaxes possible to represent the graph as a sequence of
characters: XML, N-Triples, Turtle, JSON-LD, RDFa, etc.</p>

<h5 id="rdf--xml">RDF / XML</h5>

<p>The original syntax, when the RDF was initially set standard, was
based on XML. As the first syntax for RDF, your support
tools is excellent. Moreover, the verbosity of the XML and
its hierarchical structure, the generated files are usually complex and
difficult to read.</p>

<h3 id="s">S</h3>

<h5 id="shapefile">Shapefile</h5>

<p>Open for geospatial data format developed by ESRI, which
produces software solutions for geographic information systems (GIS).
Despite being maintained by a company, its
[Specification] (http://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf)
is open and is implemented by virtually all GIS tools.</p>

<h4 id="free-software">Free Software</h4>

<p>[Free Software] (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_livre) is a manifestation of
a software in which, briefly, it allows adaptations or modifications to your code
spontaneously, ie without the need to request permission to its
owner to modify it.</p>

<p>SIC ####</p>

<ul>
  <li>See [Citizen Information Service] (# service-to-information-to-citizen) *</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="citizen-information-service">Citizen Information Service</h4>

<p>As the [Decree No. 7724] (http://www.lexml.gov.br/urn/urn:lex:br:federal:decreto:2012-05-16;7724)
regulating the [Law on Access to Information] (# law-of-access-to-information)
within the federal executive branch, the Citizens Information Service aims to:
1. help and advise the public on access to information;
2 report on the processing of documents in the units; and
3 receive and log requests for access to information.</p>

<p>and the following skills:
1 - receipt of the request for access and, where possible, the immediate provision of information;
2 - the record of the request for access to specific electronic system and the delivery protocol number, which will contain the date of application; and
3 - routing the request received and registered the party responsible for providing information unit, where applicable.</p>

<p>The SIC will be installed in physical unit identified, easily accessible and open to the public.
1 In the decentralized units where there is no SIC will be offered to receive and log service requests for access to information.
2 If the decentralized unit does not hold the information, the request will be forwarded to the central SIC organ or entity, shall notify the applicant that the protocol number and the date of receipt of the application, from which begins the period for response.</p>

<p>Organizations also have information to citizen services electronically.
The CGU centralized orders by the federal executive [e-SIC] (# e-sic).</p>

<h3 id="t">T</h3>

<h5 id="turtle">Turtle</h5>

<p>Turtle means “_ [Terse RDF Triple Language] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_ (syntax)) _”
or succinct language of RDF triples. Was created as a simplified syntax
read by both humans and by machines and
[Standardized] (http://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/) in 2014.
The indentation and the use of prefixes are
elements that facilitate the reading, as well as the grouping of triples that
have the same subject or having the same subject and the same predicate.</p>

<h3 id="x">X</h3>

<h4 id="xml">XML</h4>

<p>Means XML [Extensible Markup Language] (http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)
and is a syntax for encoding documents in a machine-readable format.
It is text-based and has as some of its
[Goals] (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-origin-goals) ease of
use and readability.</p>
