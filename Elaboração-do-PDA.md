Elaboration of the Open Data
====

The content that guides the creation of a PDA is structured in
[Manual for preparation of Plan Data Abertos](http://www.planejamento.gov.br/secretarias/upload/Arquivos/governo_aberto/manual_elaboracao_plano_dados_abertos.pdf).
This document sets out to summarize the main steps of the manual and bring
new references.

Before diving into the construction of the PDA, there is a very important previous step:
Define who will be responsible for the initiative and bring people together
relevant to the activities in question. These activities are structured in
[Systemic process]({{}} site.baseurl Process-systemic),
worth checking before you start ..

Briefly, the process of creating the PDA boils down to four steps:

## Organize Inventory Data

Before defining what data is published it is essential that the organization makes
a survey of what data has. Despite being very useful, few organs
public has this survey.

There are a few ways to do this survey, probably the best strategy is a combination of them:

* Lift, along with representatives of different areas, which are the systems used by each
* Make a list of the requested data by SIC
* If the maintenance of all systems is centralized in one area of ​​IT, get the list of systems in the area


## Prioritize the data that will be opened

The prioritization is because it is not worth the organization make an effort to publish all their data simultaneously, the cost is high and does not necessarily imply the publication of ** data relevant to the public. **

As the [Manual for drafting PDA](http://www.planejamento.gov.br/secretarias/upload/Arquivos/governo_aberto/manual_elaboracao_plano_dados_abertos.pdf), the prioritization step should consider these criteria:

1 The degree of relevance to citizens, observing especially ** demands routed via SIC ** and services sectors and most popular sites on the electronic organ. Additionally, the organization can also hold a meeting with the main consumers of your data (eg civil society, NGOs, researchers, other public bodies) to understand where to focus their needs;
2 The legal and normative commitments formally undertaken by the agency, including before international bodies (eg [OGP]({{}} site.baseurl Glossary # OGP));
3 The alignment to the Institutional Strategic Planning (IEP) and sectoral planning, as well as those related to the areas of information technology;
4 The set of information and systems under the management of the body, especially if any, structuring systems that are mandatory for cross bodies of APF;
5 The level of maturity and organization of existing information and data.

Another important source for guidance is a list of [datasets high valor](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-data-charter/g8-open-data-charter-and-technical-annex#action-2-release-of-high-value-data),
brought by the [Open Data Charter](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-date charter) the [G8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G8).

## Developing strategies for opening

Prioritized the most important data, it's time to define how they will be published. This form will be influenced by the following factors:

* Location where data are structured
* How the data is structured
* Technical capacity of the organization

In practice, these factors translate into possible scenarios of status data as structured data in multiple spreadsheets, local databases, databases located on the supplier, bulky sets, high or low platform, data warehouse, etc.

Each scenario involves a different tactic, in cases of very large data, a separation in various archives, for example, or creating API, also dependent on the ability of the organs. Data warehouse should be avoided because of the principles of raw and primary data, but may exceptionally be used when direct extraction is not feasible.

Besides the form of publication, frequency of publication and the form of hosting need to be defined, depending on the particularities of the business area of ​​information systems and related infrastructure resources available.


## Set schedule and milestones

That time is already set, for each of the prioritized data, the tactic of publishing within the constraints of the organization and characteristics of databases. It remains now to think about the publication dates of each.

This is the right time to think about healthcare communication and coordination with civil society to
increase the legitimacy and leverage data publishing. As the [Manual for drafting
PDA]((http://www.planejamento.gov.br/secretarias/upload/Arquivos/governo_aberto/manual_elaboracao_plano_dados_abertos.pdf)), share examples of how these are:

* Hold meetings with stakeholders in the data
* Hold contests applications (notable examples: (http://www.justica.gov.br/dados-open [contests MJ]),
[Contests INEP](http://hackathondadoseducacionais.org.br/)
[Contest of the Ministry Planejamento](http://dados.gov.br/noticia/conheca-os-vencedores-do-concurso-nacional-de-dados-abertos/),
[Desarrolando Latin America](http://desarrollandoamerica.org/))
* Use the data more requests SIC
* Stimulate internal use and other public bodies of published data
* Disseminate the culture in the organization of access to information and availability of public data.
