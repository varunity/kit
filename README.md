The kit is a set of documents describing the process, methods and techniques for implementing a policy of open data within an institution. He is primarily focused on organs and entities of the federal public administration for the creation and implementation of their respective [Plans Open Data] (Glossary # plan-of-open-data) (PDAs), but tries to be generic enough so you can be leveraged in other institutions.

## Background and objective

Publishing open data is present in the new digital government of Brazil and several countries worldwide trend strategy. His commitment was made by President Dilma at the signing of the [statement] (http://www.cgu.gov.br/governoaberto/a-ogp/o_que_e_Governo_Aberto.html) of [the Open Government Partnership] (http: // www.cgu.gov.br/governoaberto/a-ogp/iniciativa.asp) ([OGP] (http://www.opengovpartnership.org/)) and the various organs of the executive in both [the Partnership Action Plans] (http://www.cgu.gov.br/governoaberto/no_Brasil/plano-brasileiro/index.html).

The recommendation of the Presidency and the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management is that public managers deal with the agenda of creating Open Data Plans in their organizations.

Organizations developing Open Data Plans need guidance, methods and techniques for their creation and implementation. The proposal of the Kit is to provide the necessary inputs for these moments and serve as a guide for future reference.

## Guide to implementation of a Plan of Open Data

The creation and implementation of a Plan of Open Data for an institution can be organized into activity streams as in the following diagram:

[<Img alt = "Diagram of the systemic process of a plan to open data" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dadosgovbr/kit/master/public/img/Processo%20Sist%C3%AAmico%20de%20um%20PDA.png">](Processo-sist%C3%AAmico)

This process can be seen in greater detail in the document [Systemic Process Plan Open Data - PDA] (Process-sist% C3% AAmico).

The following sub-processes are detailed:

* [Development of a PDA] (elaborates% C3% A7% C3% A3o-of-PDA)
* [Running a PDA] (Execu% C3% A7% C3% A3o-of-PDA)
  * [Opening databases] (Opening-of-data)


## Tools

This section is an illustrative and non-exhaustive list of useful tools for [projects opening data] (Opening-of-data). All are free tools, created by communities [free software] (Glossary # software-free), and can be used by government agencies without restriction. In general, solutions for extraction, handling and preparation of data for publication on the Internet. The list is based on the [Open _Project Data_] (http://project-open-data.github.io/#tools) and [_ODI open date Review_ tech] (https://github.com/dadosgovbr/open-date -tech-review / wiki). However, is restricted to tools that can be used without the need for programming knowledge.
